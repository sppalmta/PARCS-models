# GenPMAXS files

August 2025

GENPMAXS is used to convert Polaris "t16" files to "pmax" files that can be used by PARCS

Note that the NuScale reflector segments are approximate.
The reflector segments are taken from an existing Watts Bar model, but the size of the radial reflector is increased substantially.
